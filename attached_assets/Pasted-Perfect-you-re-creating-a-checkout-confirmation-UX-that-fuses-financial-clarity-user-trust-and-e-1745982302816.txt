Perfect — you’re creating a checkout confirmation UX that fuses financial clarity, user trust, and emotional excitement into a single final moment before someone places a bid.

Here’s how to structure it:

✅ Function: What this screen needs to do
Before the user hits “Submit Bid”, this pop-up must:

Clarify what’s happening financially (pending hold, not charged)

Set clear expectations on when/why they’ll be charged

Make it feel exciting — like a high-stakes investment or a potential win

Reduce risk fear — no bait & switch, clean refund logic

Be visually consistent with the Robinhood / flight-booking vibe

🧩 Suggested UI Layout (Modal / Sheet)
Header: 🎯 Confirm Your Bid for Coverage
(Tier 1 Outlet – Current Bid: $325)

🔐 What happens now
By submitting your pitch:

A pending authorization will be placed on your card for $325.

You will only be charged if your quote is selected by the journalist.

If selected, you’ll receive an email + in-platform notification with a link to the live coverage.

If not selected, the pending hold disappears automatically — you pay nothing.

📣 Why this matters
You're pitching for limited placement in a real editorial feature.
Reporters review all submissions based on fit, not just price — so a great pitch can beat a higher bid.
This is your chance to earn real press — not pay for access, but compete for it.

💬 (Optional line, adds energy)
Think of it like booking a flight at the best price — but the runway is exclusive and your quote has to land ✈️

⚠️ Legal footer-style line
All bids are final. By submitting, you authorize QuoteBid to place a temporary charge hold on your payment method. Final billing only occurs if your pitch is selected and coverage is published. Full terms available [here].

🟢 Buttons:
[Submit Pitch & Authorize Bid] — primary button (green / orange)

Cancel — ghost button

🛠 Implementation Note (to Replit dev)
Use shadcn/ui <Dialog> or <Sheet> with side="right" or center modal. Use Stripe payment intent with capture_method=manual to authorize, then capture only if reporter confirms selection.
