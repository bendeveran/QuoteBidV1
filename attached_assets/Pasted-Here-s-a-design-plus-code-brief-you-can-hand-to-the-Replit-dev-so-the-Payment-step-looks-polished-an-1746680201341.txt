Here’s a design-plus-code brief you can hand to the Replit dev so the Payment step looks polished and sells the value.

🎨 UX / UI Goals
Section	Desired feel	Notes
Plan header	Bold, conversion-focused	“Subscribe to QuoteBid” + tagline sub-text (“Unlock the full marketplace — unlimited bids, AI tools, real-time analytics”).
Price block	Hero block in soft blue card	$99.99 / month large, with subtle “cancel anytime” underneath.
Feature bullets	Icon + short hook	• Bid-for-coverage (no retainers)
• Pay only when published
• AI voice-pitch recorder
• Verified media requests daily
Card entry	Stripe Elements field inside neutral-gray rounded box, full width	Autofocus on card number.
CTA button	Full-width primary “Start My Membership”	Shows spinner on submit.
Trust signals	Small lock icon + “Secure • Powered by Stripe” under button	Reduce abandonment.

🛠 Implementation Checklist
Two-column layout on ≥768 px
Left: value props & bullets. Right: price + card form. (Stacked on mobile.)

Use lucide-react icons (DollarSign, FileText, Mic, ShieldCheck) for bullets.

Copy suggestions
Headline: “Bid for coverage. Pay only for results.”
Bullet 1: “Set your own price — no retainers, no flat fees.”
Bullet 2: “Payment only when your quote is published.”
Bullet 3: “AI Voice Pitch recorder transcribes on the fly.”
Bullet 4: “Daily, verified requests from top-tier journalists.”

One-liner to paste for the dev
“Revamp PaymentStep.tsx: add a two-column Tailwind layout, hero price card, iconized bullet list (DollarSign, FileText, Mic, ShieldCheck), full-width Stripe card box, and a secure ‘Start My Membership’ button with spinner. Follow the UX spec above; copy bullets verbatim. Keep the existing handleSuccess logic untouched.”

This keeps the Stripe wiring as is but gives you a modern, persuasive checkout screen.
