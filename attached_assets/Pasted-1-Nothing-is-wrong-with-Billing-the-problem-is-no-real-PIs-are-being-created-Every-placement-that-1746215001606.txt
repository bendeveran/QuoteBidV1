1 — Nothing is wrong with Billing; the problem is no real PIs are being created
Every placement that shows Ready for Billing still has pitch.payment_intent_id = NULL, so the Billing endpoint quite correctly returns:

css
Copy
Edit
400 { message:"No payment intent found for this placement" }
Until the bid flow writes a real Stripe ID into that column, the modal will keep erroring. Stop tweaking the admin code and finish the bid flow.

2 — Hard‑wire the PI creation on bid submit
2.1 Server (POST /api/pitch or /api/bid)
ts
Copy
Edit
const pi = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount:  bidPriceInCents,
  currency:'usd',
  capture_method:'manual',
  metadata: { pitchId: newPitch.id, userId: req.user.id }
});

await db.pitch.update(newPitch.id, {
  payment_intent_id:        pi.id,
  authorization_expires_at: new Date(Date.now() + 6.5*24*60*60*1000)
});
2.2 Return both IDs to the front‑end
json
Copy
Edit
{ "pitchId": 42, "clientSecret": "pi_..._secret_...", "paymentIntentId": "pi_..." }
2.3 Front‑end
ConfirmBidDialog doesn’t need pitchId anymore to create a PI—it already exists.

Use the clientSecret to render the payment‑sheet; ignore paymentIntentId.

3 — Migrate existing rows once (optional)
sql
Copy
Edit
UPDATE pitch
SET    payment_intent_id = e.value
FROM   jsonb_each_text(metadata) e
WHERE  e.key = 'paymentIntentId'   -- only if you logged it in metadata earlier
  AND  payment_intent_id IS NULL;
Otherwise just let old test pitches die; create fresh ones after you ship 2 — that’s cleaner.

4 — Smoke test (takes 60 seconds)
bash
Copy
Edit
# 1. Place a new bid via UI (card 4242 etc.)
# 2. psql: SELECT id, payment_intent_id FROM pitch ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
#    -> should display 'pi_3XYZ…'
# 3. Admin > Billing Manager -> Bill Now
# 4. Should fetch PI (last‑4, $ amount) and Capture without error
# 5. Table row status flips to 'Billed'
If step 2 shows NULL, the server code in step 2.1 is still not running. That’s the only place left to fix.

5 — Fail‑safe logging (add once)
ts
Copy
Edit
console.log('[PITCH]', pitch.id, 'saved PI', pitch.payment_intent_id);
When you don’t see that line after bidding, you know exactly where to look.

Ship the bid‑flow patch, run the smoke test, and the Billing modal will finally light up instead of screaming “No payment intent found.”
