Pitch‑Card & Progress Tracker — UI/UX Requirements for Replit

1. Pitch Card (content & labeling)
Element	New Behavior
Outlet line	Remove the placeholder text “Published by reporter: Unknown Publication …”. Dynamically inject the actual outlet name (e.g., Forbes, WSJ).
Stage label	Display the current deal stage (same wording used in admin “Pitch Management”)—e.g., Pending ➝ Sent to Reporter ➝ Reporter Interested ➝ In Review ➝ Published. The label must update in real time as the pitch’s stage changes.
Edit icon	Only visible while the pitch is in Pending. Clicking it opens the existing “Edit Pitch” modal.

2. Visual Stage Tracker (DoorDash‑style)
Embed this tracker inside the pitch card, directly under the headline block.
css
CopyEdit (Match Pitch Management stages)
[●] Pending ——— [○] Sent to Reporter ——— [○] Reporter Interested ——— [○] Not Interested ——— [○] Successful Coverage

Different UI words in the customer side that match these api keys / db function stages. 

Pitch Pending, Pitch Sent, Reporter Accepted, Reporter Denied, Successful Coverage. 

* Rules
    * Filled circle = current stage.
    * Connecting bar animates left‑to‑right as the pitch advances.
    * Hover/tooltip on each node shows timestamp of that stage.

3. “Track Pitch Progress” Action
* New button inside every pitch card: Track Pitch Progress
* Opens the existing “Review Pitch” modal, scrolled to a new Progress tab that contains the stage tracker, full change log, and any reporter messages.

4. Active vs. Expired Tabs
* Add top‑level filter tabs: Active Pitches | Expired Pitches
    * Active = any stage before Published/Expired.
    * Expired = pitches that reached the “Expires” date without progressing or were manually closed.

5. Reporter Notifications
* When a reporter requests more info (via their portal), trigger:
    * Frontend — in‑app toast + badge on the corresponding pitch card.
    * Backend — WebSocket push to update the stage tracker, flagging a new sub‑stage “Reporter Follow‑Up Needed” right after Interested.

Deliverables
1. Updated React components for PitchCard, StageTracker, and ReviewPitchModal.
2. WebSocket event hooks for stage/status changes and reporter messages.
3. Unit tests for conditional rendering (stage updates, edit icon visibility, Active/Expired filters).
Please keep styling consistent with existing design tokens; only extend where required for the tracker animation.
