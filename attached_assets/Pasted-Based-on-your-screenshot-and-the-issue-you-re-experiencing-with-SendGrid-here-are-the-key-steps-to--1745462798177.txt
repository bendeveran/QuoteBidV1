Based on your screenshot and the issue you're experiencing with SendGrid, here are the key steps to resolve the email sending problem:

Problem Analysis:
Your domains and sender emails are verified in SendGrid (as shown in the screenshot)

You're still getting errors when trying to send test emails

The domain shown is "rubiconggroup.com" (note the extra 'g') - this might be a typo in your setup

Immediate Fixes:
Domain Verification Check:

Double-check that your actual domain (rubiconprgroup.com) is properly authenticated in SendGrid

The screenshot shows "rubiconggroup.com" - if this is incorrect, you'll need to:

Remove the incorrect domain

Add the correct domain (rubiconprgroup.com)

Complete domain authentication (DNS records)

Sender Email Verification:

Ensure ben@rubiconprgroup.com is verified (not ben@rubiconggroup.com)

Check your email for the verification link from SendGrid

Code Implementation:

typescript
// Update your email.ts with proper error handling
import sgMail from '@sendgrid/mail';

sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY!);

export async function sendOpportunityNotification(email: string) {
  const msg = {
    to: email,
    from: 'ben@rubiconprgroup.com', // Hardcode verified sender temporarily
    subject: 'New PR Opportunity',
    text: 'Test email content',
    html: '<strong>Test email content</strong>'
  };

  try {
    await sgMail.send(msg);
    console.log('Email sent successfully');
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Detailed SendGrid error:', error.response?.body || error);
    return false;
  }
}
Next Steps:
Domain Authentication (Recommended for production):

In SendGrid: Settings → Sender Authentication → Domain Authentication

Add your correct domain (rubiconprgroup.com)

Add the required DNS records to your domain registrar

Test with Simple Email:

bash
# Test with curl (in Replit shell)
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email":"ben@rubiconprgroup.com"}' \
http://localhost:5000/api/test-email
Check Logs:

The error logs from console.error in the code above will show exactly why sends are failing

Common issues include:

Incorrect domain/sender

Missing DNS records

Spam filters blocking test emails

Would you like me to guide you through any of these steps in more detail? The domain typo (rubiconggroup vs rubiconprgroup) is likely the root cause, but we should verify all aspects of your SendGrid setup.
