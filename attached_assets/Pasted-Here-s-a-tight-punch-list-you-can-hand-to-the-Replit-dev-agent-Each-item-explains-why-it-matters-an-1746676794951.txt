Here’s a tight punch-list you can hand to the Replit dev agent.
Each item explains why it matters and exactly what to change, so they can tackle the bugs without breaking the wizard skeleton we just stood up.

🛠 Fix-ups for Agreement Step & Wizard UI
#	Issue	What to change	Why
1	Signature canvas is over-kill	Front-end – Remove the <SignaturePad> component.
Replace with a simple “I agree” checkbox plus an input for “Full legal name” (required).

Back-end – Accept fullName (string) instead of an image in POST /signup/stage/advance when action:'agreement'. Store it in agreement_signed as plain text for now (we can move to PDF embed later).	Keeps the step friction-free; most SaaS products treat typed name + checkbox as e-signature.
2	Agreement isn’t saving / stage not advancing	In db.advanceStage(email,'agreement', data) add:
ts\nawait db.query(`\n UPDATE users \n SET agreement_signed = $1,\n signup_stage = 'payment'\n WHERE email = $2;`, [data.fullName, email]);\n
Return {stage:'payment'}.	Wizard polling will now see stage change and auto-advance to Payment.
3	Progress bar styling & visibility	In SignupProgress.tsx:
• Change numbers to filled circles only for completed steps; current step gets bold text and primary color.
• Increase line height / color contrast (border-neutral-300).
• Shrink circle size to h-6 w-6 text-sm.	Makes the bar readable against white background and clearly shows which step is next.
4	Can’t see next step cards (viewport too tall)	Wrap each step in overflow-auto max-h-[calc(100vh-120px)] so the page scrolls if content grows.	Prevents “blank below fold” on small laptop screens.
5	Require checkbox before POST	Add front-end guard: disable “I Agree & Continue” button until checkbox is checked and fullName.length > 2.	Blocks empty submissions, removes server 400s.
6	Remove stage ‘Complete’ (we only need 3)	Progress array → ['agreement','payment','profile']. Remove “4 Complete” label.	Cleaner UX; dashboard redirect is the completion.

Suggested commit sequence (one PR)
UI tweaks (items 3, 4, 6) – purely front-end.

Signature → fullName refactor (items 1, 5).

Back-end update to advanceStage (item 2) + adjust TypeScript types.

Manual test:

Enter email → agree (typed name) → wizard advances to Payment placeholder.

DB row shows signup_stage='payment' & agreement_signed='John Smith'.

Push, review, merge into signup-wizard branch.
Feature flag stays off, so prod remains untouched.

Once Payment and Profile steps are wired the same way, we’ll flip NEXT_SIGNUP_WIZARD=true and sunset the broken legacy flow.
