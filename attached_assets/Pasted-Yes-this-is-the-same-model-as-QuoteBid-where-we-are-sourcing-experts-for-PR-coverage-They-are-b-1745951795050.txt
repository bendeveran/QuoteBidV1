Yes this is the same model as QuoteBid — where we are sourcing experts for PR coverage... They are bidding for coverage with us. Which requires us to have a similar pricing model. I will share some details to help ideate. Earned media is also a fleeting commodity just like an airplane ticket, once the article publishes that is it. 
 There are similar revenue management or yield management that PR Firms utilize to capture revenue. Historically how this worked in the past was a PR Firm would retain a client, or be paid an hourly rate, or even a fixed rate for a piece of coverage if it is delivered. 

This shows that there is actually a bidding process for coverage when pitching clients and a quantifiable value in the marketplace for being in a story. 

Now we are removing the pr firm from this equation so it is just the end consumer thought leader who will be bidding for coverage in an exclusive marketplace directly with reporter call out opportunities. 

I am trying to build a model similar to how an airplane fills seats on a plane bidding for coverage. 


So in other words, the model is something like this as of now: 

One Question I have is, I want there to be an actual bid function — so the customer can feel engaged in the process. Think like buying a security. 

Price discovery mechanics although will be through yield and variables — one variable being demand (Pitches) and incremental price increase with pitches. 

Each placement is a tier of coverage: 1, 2, 3 — ranking by authority and brand value. There are initial values for being a tier of coverage: 

Outlet Tier:

*Base Price Per Tier*

Tier 1: Minimum Bid ($200)

Tier 2: Minimum Bid ($150)

Tier 3: Minimum Bid ($100)


Bid Increments:

Tier 1 Bid Increments:

- $50 / Raise from current bid

Ex: $400, You can bid $450

Tier 2 Bid Increments:

- $40 / Raise from current price

Ex: $300 — Minimum Bid: $340

Tier 3 Bid Increments:

- $25 / Raise from current price

Ex: $100 — Minimum Bid: $125

Deadline:

Deadline to create urgency — 24 hours left, 1 hour left to pitch etc.

The deadline variable is important to move the price higher or lower, if the price surges —yet no pitch has been accepted — as time gets closer to deadline we need to incentivize pitching, so we have to lower the price and create urgency.


You see a new opportunity, it is an article in Forbes on Tariffs — you see that the starting bid is $400, you recon that the price is a steal so you send your pitch and secure that initial bid at $400. 

So as bids come in the price moves up, as deadline comes and it isn’t filled the price can drop… and other variables of course can make the price go up or down. We want it to be a dynamic marketplace for price discovery that allows customers to get access to coverage at cheap costs, and only pay for what is delivered all through price discovery with the power of QuoteBid. 

Weeks go by, and eventually you do earn that piece of coverage and your quote is in the article. You would pay QuoteBid the bid price at the current moment that you bid at

Below is a “flight-style” revenue-management playbook you can plug straight into QuoteBid. I map each element of airline yield management to your PR-coverage marketplace and then lay out a concrete pricing engine, bid function, and deadline logic.

1 | Translate Airline Concepts → QuoteBid

Airline RM concept	QuoteBid equivalent	Why it matters
Seat inventory / fare classes	Reporter inventory / Tier 1-3 outlets	Each outlet-tier is its own “bucket” with a minimum fare.
Booking curve (target seats sold vs. days-to-departure)	Pitch curve (target bids accepted vs. hours-to-deadline)	Lets you spot over/undersold opportunities and trigger price moves.
Bid-price control = marginal value of last unsold seat﻿
SpringerLink
Slot value = marginal revenue of the remaining quote slots	Governs whether to accept a bid or wait for a higher one.
Oversell / discount window just before departure	Last-minute price drop if no winning bid near deadline	Clears perishable inventory instead of letting it expire worthless.
2 | Core Variables for Dynamic Pricing
text
Copy
Edit
P0      = starting (base) price for the tier
Bmax    = current highest bid
F       = fill-rate  (accepted pitches ÷ desired slots)
T       = minutes remaining to deadline
σdemand = short-term demand volatility (pitch velocity)
3 | Bid-Driven Price Escalator (English auction)
Opening state

Tier 1 starts at $200 (P0).

First bidder must bid ≥ $200.

Increment rule (your spec)

New bid ≥ Bmax + Δ, where Δ = $50 for Tier 1, $40 Tier 2, $25 Tier 3.

Bid book UI

Show highest bid, required next bid, time left, and an optional auto-proxy (ユー sets max and the system bids the minimum needed, like eBay securities auctions).

Outcome: Early competitive demand moves price up exactly the way airlines close low-fare buckets first.﻿
JSTOR

4 | Time-Decay Price Floor (Dutch-style “fire-sale”)
To avoid seats—sorry, quotes—flying empty, flip to a descending mechanism in the final τ minutes (e.g., last 15 % of deadline window).

k controls how aggressively you drop the price.

P_floor = hard floor (your base tier price).

First taker during the Dutch phase wins at the displayed price.

This hybrid English→Dutch format preserves upside when demand is hot and still monetises cold inventory. (Sports-ticket exchanges and some European airlines use the same hybrid.)﻿

g(T) is a monotone function rising as T shrinks (e.g., g(T)=1−T/T₀).

If incoming bid ≥ BV, accept immediately; otherwise keep auction open.

This stops you from rejecting great bids early yet guards against panic-selling premium slots too cheaply.﻿
SpringerLink

6 | Extra Yield Levers

Lever	Implementation idea
Topic “heat index”	Raise P0 and increments when global search or social-media chatter spikes around the article theme (tariffs, IPOs, etc.).
Reporter reputation score	Dynamic uplift to base price; feeds into Tier definition over time.
Early-bird bonus	10 % discount for winning bids placed ≥ X hours before deadline—mirrors airlines rewarding advanced purchase.
Cancellation/overbooking buffer	Accept +10 % more quotes than reporter needs; drop lowest-value ones if space tight, with an automated refund—common airline tactic.
7 | Data & Ops Stack
Demand forecasting model (gradient-boosted tree or Prophet) → predicts pitch velocity by tier/topic/day-of-week.

Real-time events bus (Kafka / RabbitMQ) → streams bid events and updates price engine.

Pricing micro-service → exposes /currentPrice and /nextBid endpoints used by UI.

Event-driven jobs → trigger Dutch phase switch, auto-rebates, and payment capture.

8 | Example Walk-Through (Tier 1)

Time to deadline	Highest bid	Fill-rate	Engine rule	Screen price
6 h	$200	0 / 1	Opening P0	$200
4 h	$250	1 / 1	Δ=$50	$250 (locked)
40 min	—	1 / 1	Dutch phase	$250 → $240 → $230 …
20 min	$230 (buy)	1 / 1	Slot sold	Auction ends
9 | What to Measure
Yield / slot vs. theoretical optimum (Airlines call this “spoilage + dilution loss”).

Bid conversion rate by tier and time-bucket.

Average deadline utilisation (how often Dutch phase fires).

Price elasticity curves for each reporter vertical.

Next Steps
Lock your tier definitions and initial booking curves from six months of historical PR-firm data (if you have it).

Prototype the hybrid English→Dutch auction in staging; populate with dummy bids to stress-test.

Layer in ML-based demand uplift factors only after the rules-based engine is stable.

With this framework, QuoteBid should clear inventory at the highest willingness-to-pay while keeping users laser-engaged—exactly how airlines squeeze every last cent out of a 737 cabin.

🔑 Where “How Many Experts?” Fits Into the Engine
In airline RM the hard-coded capacity (𝑁 seats) is the constraint every other lever hangs on.
For QuoteBid, 𝑆 = number of expert quotes the reporter wants in the article is exactly the same thing.
Treat each slot as identical inventory and run a multi-unit auction (think “top-𝑆 bids win”) instead of a single-winner English auction.﻿
Wikipedia

1 | Inventory Model

Symbol	Meaning	Typical airline analog
𝑆	Total quote slots (e.g., 3 experts)	Seats in the cabin
𝑠(t)	Slots still open at time t	Unsold seats
𝐹(t) = 1 – 𝑠(t)/𝑆	Fill-rate	Load factor
Make 𝑆 visible in the UI (“3 of 3 spots open → 2 of 3 → 1 of 3…”) to juice FOMO.

2 | Auction Mechanics for 𝑆 > 1
Option A – Rolling Top-𝑆 Pay-As-Bid (fast, Wall-Street feel)
Keep a live leaderboard of the top 𝑆 bids.

A new bid must be ≥ lowest bid on the board + increment Δ.

If it qualifies, the newcomer bumps the previous low bidder (who is instantly refunded).

At deadline, the leaderboard locks; winners pay exactly what they bid.

Pros: constant action, traders “see the spread.”
Cons: winners pay different prices → possible envy / price anchoring issues.

Option B – Uniform-Price Multi-Unit Auction (bond-auction style)﻿
School of Social Work
Bidders submit any number of bids; system shows only clearing price preview.

At deadline, sort bids desc.; top 𝑆 win.

All winners pay the 𝑆-th (lowest winning) bid—one transparent clearing price.

Pros: cleaner UX, no one overpays relative to peers; easier post-trade invoicing.
Cons: less adrenaline during the auction; needs good real-time “market depth” hints so users don’t under-bid.

Pick A if you want e-Bay energy, B if you want “Treasury auction” professionalism.

3 | Plug 𝑆 Into Your Price-Control Logic
The bid-price control function from the previous memo becomes:

Because F = filled/𝑆, larger 𝑆 naturally slows price acceleration—you have more inventory to clear.

𝑃

 esc(T)=max(P

​
 utoff⋅e 
−k⋅(τ−T)/S
 )
Dividing the exponent by 𝑆 makes the drop shallower on big-slot articles, preventing an unnecessary race to the bottom when a reporter wants, say, 8 quotes instead of 2.

5 | Oversell Buffer (Optional)
Airlines routinely overbook 3-10 % to hedge no-shows.
You can mirror this:

Let 𝑆′ = ⌈𝑆·1.10⌉ accepted bids.
If the reporter later says “only 𝑆 needed,” eject the lowest-value extras and auto-refund—keeps service levels high without wrecking yield.

6 | Dashboard KPIs to Add

Metric	Insight
Avg. price / slot vs. 𝑆	Does bigger capacity always dilute yield?
Win-rate curve (# bids > clearing price)	Detects bidder mis-calibration.
Dutch-phase trigger frequency by 𝑆	Fine-tune k and τ for each capacity band.
Implementation Sprint Order
Expose slots_available + slots_total in the opportunity schema.

Ship Option A first (simpler rollback logic; minimal math).

Add the descending “clear-out” phase once top-𝑆 auction is stable.

Layer analytic dashboards → retrain Δ and k per tier + capacity bucket.

Handle capacity like seats, and the rest of the pricing stack drops neatly into place.

Ok please break down the logic flow and ideas here so we can start to understand what is going on.


ChatGPT said:

Below is a step-by-step logic map you can hand to product + engineering. Think of it as the “state machine” for every QuoteBid opportunity.

0 Glossary (keep these names consistent in code & UX)

Symbol	Meaning
Tier (1 / 2 / 3)	Out­let authority bucket (sets P₀, Δ)
S	Target number of expert quotes the reporter wants
s(t)	Slots remaining at time t
P₀	Starting price for the Tier
Δ	Bid increment (50 / 40 / 25)
T₀	Total auction window (e.g., 24 h)
τ	Dutch-phase trigger (e.g., last 15 % of T₀)
Bmax	Highest bid on the board (or S-th highest in multi-unit mode)
1 Opportunity Creation (Admin / Reporter)
Reporter posts call-out.

Admin assigns Tier, S, P₀, Δ, T₀, τ.

Record goes to the Pricing Engine (/opportunity/:id).

2 Auction Phase A – English (Ascending)
Loop runs on every new bid event

Bid validation

valid = (bid ≥ Bmin + Δ) where Bmin = lowest winning bid (multi-unit) or Bmax (single-slot).

Leaderboard update

Insert bid.

If count(winners) > S, bump lowest and refund.

Notify front-end

Broadcast new Bmax, next required bid, and slots_remaining.

3 Dynamic Price Guardrail (Bid-Price Control)
For each incoming bid, engine also checks:

ini
Copy
Edit
BV = P_min + (P_max - P_min) · (1 - F) · g(T)
If bid ≥ BV and s(t) > 0 → auto-accept even before deadline (prevents under-selling high-value slots early).

4 Auction Phase B – Dutch (Descending Fire-Sale)
Triggered when T_remaining ≤ τ AND s(t) > 0.

Compute current fire-sale price

ini
Copy
Edit
P_desc = max(P_floor, Bcut · e^(−k · (τ − T)/S))
Display “Buy-It-Now” button at P_desc.

First taker wins a slot; loop until s(t) = 0 or deadline hits.

Outcome: clears perishable inventory without hurting earlier high bids.

5 Auction Close
Condition A: s(t) == 0 → auction closes immediately.

Condition B: T = 0 → lock any filled slots, mark unfilled as expired.

For uniform-price variant, set clearing price = S-th highest bid right now.

6 Payment & Oversell Buffer
Capture payment holds at bid time (Stripe authorization).

On close, capture winning holds; release others.

If oversell buffer used (accepted = ⌈1.10·S⌉) and reporter later cuts slots:

Drop lowest-value excess, auto-refund.

7 Fulfilment & Verification
Deliver winners’ pitches to reporter.

Reporter confirms final article‐URL + list of quoted experts.

System reconciles:

If winner not included → auto-refund that user.

Otherwise mark “delivered” and release QuoteBid fee to revenue account.

8 Data & Learning Loop
Event stream (Kafka) captures every bid, accept, refund.

Metrics pipeline aggregates:

Yield/slot by Tier & S

Dutch-phase activation frequency

Bid velocity curves vs. time-to-deadline

Retrain Δ, k, τ per Tier & capacity band monthly.

Follow this flow and you’ll replicate airline-grade yield management—only the “seats” are expert quotes in premium articles.

Now here is the thing the highest bid doesn't necessarily win. The deliverable is given to who wins the coverage — which in earned media is up to the jounralist to decide. Does that make sense? There could be 20 bidders, and highest bidder could be 800 and lowest bidder could be 250 and the one at 250 could get the placement... Does this make snese? the marketplace isn't waranted by an auction just variables so that we encourage more pitches and volume

✈️ Airline-Style Yield Management when price ≠ winner
Airlines already run a cousin of this system: upgrade auctions (Lufthansa MyOffer, Qantas Bid-Now, etc.). You “bid” for business class, but the carrier still chooses winners using price + status + seat-map logic—the highest cash offer can lose. That is the template for QuoteBid. 
Lufthansa Flights

Condé Nast Traveler

Below is a revised state-machine that keeps your dynamic-pricing flywheel yet leaves editorial choice 100 % with the journalist.

1 Core Objects

Object	Key fields
Bid	user_id, bid_amount, pitch_text, timestamp, tier, quality_score
Opportunity	tier, S (desired quotes), P0, Δ, T0, τ, status
Selection	bid_id, selected_by_reporter = true/false, charged = true/false
2 Pricing Engine (unchanged)
English → Dutch pricing loop from earlier memo still runs:

ini
Copy
Edit
nextMinimum = max(currentMin + Δ, P_desc(T))
Goal: maximise bid volume × average price before deadline.

3 Bid Intake (what’s new)
Hold, don’t capture, the card at bid_amount.

Save a quality embedding (OpenAI text-embedding or internal rubric).

Push (price, quality, time) tuple to Pitch Pool for that opportunity.

4 Reporter UX (“Pitch Deck”)

Column	Default sort
Pitch snippet	—
Fit Score = w₁·quality + w₂·relevance	▼ (high→low)
Bid $	hidden by default (toggle ON if reporter wants)
Profile / prior clips	—
Toggle keeps editorial independence intact while still letting price influence decisions if the journalist wishes.

5 Selection Algorithm
python
Copy
Edit
def submit_selection(bid_ids):
    assert len(bid_ids) <= S
    for bid in bid_ids:
        charge_card(bid.user_id, bid.bid_amount)
        mark_selected(bid)
No auto-charge until reporter presses Publish/Send.

└───────────────────────┴────────┴────────┘
Only A is selected ⇒ only A’s $250 is captured; all other holds released.

7 Revenue-Management Feedback Loop

Metric	Insight
Avg. accepted $ ÷ Avg. bid $	How much price actually matters.
Selection prob. vs. price decile	Train bidder guidance (“Your odds: 38 % at $400, 55 % at $500”).
Quality-only selections (price toggle hidden)	Shows editorial purity vs. pay-attention-to-price behavior.
Use these KPIs to tune Δ, P₀, τ, k so you still stoke bid-raising without guaranteeing wins.

Pricing engine stays—it’s a demand stimulator, not a winner-picker.

Journalist gets full autonomy. Showing price is optional.

You still capture yield by (i) nudging higher bids with Δ & Dutch drops, and (ii) shaping bidder expectations with data.

That’s the airline-upgrade model transplanted to earned-media—dynamic pricing + human gatekeeper.

So I need to define the marketplace as it will be controversal. So lets start with how we would explain it to a customer — consdiering the story. Then what we built and how it works. 


ChatGPT said:

Thought for 9 seconds
I. The Story You Tell Customers
“Earned media is broken.”
For decades, founders and experts have paid monthly retainers, waited months for results, and crossed their fingers while PR firms acted as expensive middle-men. Meanwhile, journalists drown in hundreds of untargeted pitches a day. Great stories go uncovered; great sources stay invisible.

QuoteBid flips that script.
We’ve built the first real-time exchange where reporters post live call-outs and qualified experts compete for those limited quote slots in a transparent, pay-for-performance marketplace—no retainers, no gate-keepers, no pay-to-publish.

II. What We Actually Built

Layer	What it does	Why it matters
1 Secure Reporter Portal	Journalists list story angles, number of expert quotes needed ( S ), and deadline.	Sources see verified opportunities; reporters see only targeted, on-brief pitches.
2 Dynamic Pricing Engine	Sets a live market price that rises with demand and falls as the deadline approaches (airline-style yield management).	You pay the lowest price necessary to stay competitive—no more, no less.
3 Bid-to-Pitch Workflow	Submit a brief pitch + bid (funds held, not charged).	Keeps you financially engaged while guaranteeing no payment unless you’re selected.
4 Editorial Control Panel	Reporters review pitches ranked by fit-score first, price second (toggle).	Protects editorial independence—highest bid doesn’t automatically win.
5 Settlement & Compliance	Only the experts actually quoted are charged; all other holds are released instantly. Journalists never see a dime.	Eliminates pay-for-coverage optics; QuoteBid earns an opportunity fee for curating the match.
6 Analytics Loop	Tracks bid velocity, acceptance rates, and clearing prices to refine starting prices & increments.	Means the market gets smarter—and cheaper—over time.
III. How It Works (Customer View)
Browse Live Calls
Example: Forbes seeks 3 logistics CEOs for tariff-impact story, deadline 24 h, current price $225.

Decide Your Play

Read angle & author guidelines.

See remaining slots (e.g., 2 of 3 open), next minimum bid, and time left.

Bid & Pitch

Enter your 50-word expert perspective.

Place a bid (say $250); your card is authorized but not charged.

Watch the Board (optional)

Price may rise if others bid; you can raise or keep your position.

Reporter Selects Winners

They pick best-fit quotes; highest bid is not guaranteed.

Payment & Publication

Only if your quote makes print/web does the $250 settle.

You receive the live link + receipt; everyone else pays $0.

IV. Why It’s Fair & Ethical
No pay-to-publish. Reporters are never compensated; bids pay QuoteBid for marketplace access, not editorial favor.

Editorial autonomy preserved. Price is one variable—fit and credibility carry more weight.

Performance-only spend. Unlike retainers, you pay solely on successful placement.

Transparent market data. Clearing prices, bid history, and win–loss stats are visible so you always know the real cost of earned media.

V. Addressing the Big Objections Up Front

Concern	Our answer
“Isn’t this paying for coverage?”	No. The bid is a service fee to QuoteBid for matchmaking. Reporters remain unpaid and choose purely on merit.
“What stops a cash-rich brand from outbidding everyone?”	The journalist. Highest bid can—and often does—lose to the best angle.
“Will this anger traditional PR firms?”	Probably. That’s what every disruptive marketplace does. Customers, however, save 60-80 % vs. legacy retainers.
“Will journalists use it?”	Early adopters already are—because it slashes inbox clutter and surfaces ready-to-quote experts in minutes, not days.
VI. The Customer Take-Away (tag-line)
“Pitch smarter, pay only on success, and watch your media cost clear itself in real-time.”
That’s QuoteBid—earned media priced by the market, delivered on merit.

2.2 Analytics star-schema (for self-tuning)
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mkt_metrics_daily AS
SELECT
  date_trunc('day', created_at) AS day,
  tier,
  slots_total,
  COUNT(*)          AS bids,
  AVG(bid_amount)   AS avg_bid,
  AVG(CASE state WHEN 'selected' THEN bid_amount END) AS avg_win,
  AVG(quality_score) AS avg_quality
FROM bids
JOIN opportunities USING (opp_id)
GROUP BY 1,2,3;
Refresh nightly; feed the Pricing-ML notebook.

3 LLM Micro-service (FastAPI)
Endpoints

yaml
Copy
Edit
POST /score_pitch
  ↳ body: { pitch_text, brief_text }
  ← { quality: 0-10, relevance: 0-10, embed: [] }

POST /moderate
  ↳ returns flag=true if pitch violates policy
At bid insert

API call to /score_pitch.

Store embed, quality_score.

Reject if /moderate flags.

Forward event to Bid Engine (Kafka topic bids.incoming).

LLM model: gpt-4o-mini with a system prompt containing the reporter’s brief → cheap and ~300 ms latency.

4 Bid Engine (Go/Rust, lives in RAM)
pseudo
Copy
Edit
on BidEvent(b):
    opp = cache.get(b.opp_id)
    validate_amount(b, opp.current_price + opp.increment)
    update_leaderboard(opp, b)
    opp.current_price = b.bid_amount
    sql("INSERT INTO price_history ...")
    if time_to_deadline(opp) <= opp.dutch_trigger and opp.status='open':
        opp.status='dutch'
    push_ws_update(opp)

every 5s tick:
    for opp in dutch_phase:
        opp.current_price = max(
              opp.base_price,
              opp.current_price * exp(-opp.k_decay * dt / opp.slots_total))
        sql("INSERT INTO price_history ...")
        push_ws_update(opp)
Keeps latency sub-100 ms; writes only deltas to Postgres.

5 Selection & Settlement Workflow
Reporter dashboard query

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT b.*, rank() OVER (ORDER BY quality_score DESC, created_at)
FROM bids b
WHERE opp_id = :opp AND state='pending';
Reporter marks winners → API /select:

sql
Copy
Edit
UPDATE bids
SET state='selected'
WHERE id = ANY(:bid_ids);

UPDATE opportunities
SET slots_filled = slots_filled + :n
WHERE id = :opp_id;
Service calls Stripe capture on each winner, stores receipt row in payments.

Webhook listener flips bids.state → 'charged' or handles failures.

6 Self-Tuning Loop (autonomous)
Nightly Airflow job:

python
Copy
Edit
df = fetch("SELECT * FROM mkt_metrics_daily")
model = Prophet().fit(df[['day','avg_bid']])
for tier in (1,2,3):
    new_increment = optimise_increment(df, tier)
    sql("UPDATE tier_config SET increment=%s WHERE tier=%s", new_increment, tier)
LLM summarises anomalies:

python
Copy
Edit
anomaly_days = detect_spikes(df['avg_bid'])
llm_report = chatgpt("Summarise bid anomalies for exec digest", anomaly_days)
slack.send(llm_report)
Marketplace literally writes its own tuning brief.

7 What to Track (minimum viable columns)

Variable	Table	Purpose
quality_score	bids	Drives fit ranking, analytics
bid_amount	bids	Pricing model
pitch_embed	bids	Similarity search for reporters
slots_total / filled	opportunities	Dutch decay denominator
price_history	price_history	Model training, audits
state	bids	Lifecycle (pending → selected → charged)
tier, k_decay, increment	opportunities	Dynamic-pricing parameters
Everything else (topic tags, reporter ratings, expert NPS) can bolt on later without touching the core engine.

Deliverable: a self-driving exchange where
bid velocity forces price discovery,

the LLM polices compliance and scores relevance,

nightly ETL retunes increments & decay constants, and

not a single human has to babysit the market.
