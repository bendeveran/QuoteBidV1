1. Introduction
This Platform Access Agreement ("Agreement") governs the terms under which You access and use the proprietary PR bidding platform operated by Rubicon PR Group LLC (the "Provider"). By clicking "I Agree," creating an account, or making payment, You agree to be legally bound by this Agreement.
2. Access & Subscription
2.1 Platform Use. The Provider offers a digital marketplace allowing qualified users to view and respond to real media opportunities by submitting editorial pitches and placing monetary bids for consideration.
2.2 Monthly Subscription Fee. A recurring fee of $99.99/month grants You access to the Platform's media request database and the ability to submit bids. This is a non-refundable access fee.
2.3 Bidding Model. You may place a monetary bid in connection with a specific journalist's query. You will only be charged the bid amount if your pitch is selected and successfully published by the journalist or outlet.
2.4 Fees Go to Provider Only. All fees collected via the Platform—including subscription fees and successful bid fees—are payable solely to the Provider. No portion of any fee is paid to journalists, publishers, or media outlets, nor does the payment represent compensation to any media personnel.
2.5 Opportunity Fee Disclosure. The bid fee paid upon successful publication is an opportunity fee for the use of the Provider's editorial matchmaking infrastructure—not for the purchase, guarantee, or influence of content. The Provider does not and cannot guarantee media outcomes.
3. No Affiliation with Media Outlets
3.1 Independent Relationships. The Provider is an independent public relations firm. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or representative of any publication or journalist listed on the platform.

6. Disclaimers & Limitations
6.1 No Guarantee. The Provider does not guarantee publication, visibility, tone, or performance of any editorial piece. Platform access is a tool—not a promise of outcomes.
